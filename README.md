# Flowchart 

🍁🎗️
Start: Data Source
Objective: Analyze crime trends over time.

🌊Data Cleaning Process
Remove duplicates: Eliminate any redundant entries in the dataset to avoid skewed analysis.
Handle missing data: Address missing values using techniques like imputation or removing incomplete rows.
Rename columns: Ensure all column names are descriptive and consistent for easier interpretation.
Convert data types: Convert columns into appropriate data types (e.g., date, numeric, categorical) to facilitate further analysis.

🗝️📈📉Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Summarize data: Provide descriptive statistics like mean, median, mode, etc., to understand data distribution.
Visualize trends: Use graphical techniques such as histograms or scatter plots to reveal patterns and relationships.
Detect outliers: Identify any unusual data points that may require special attention or removal.

🚀Trend Identification & Visualization Techniques
Line Charts (Time-Series): Visualize changes in crime over time, detecting patterns or spikes in certain years.
Bar Plots (Category-wise): Compare crime occurrences across different categories such as types of crime or regions.
Pie Charts (Proportions): Display proportions of various crime types or categories within the dataset.

🥀Conclusion & Recommendations
Key trends identified: Summarize the most significant findings from the analysis (e.g., rise or fall in certain crime types).
Regional analysis: Identify regions with higher crime rates or specific trends.
Policy suggestions: Provide actionable recommendations to policymakers for reducing crime based on the analysis.

 🔍Future Research:
Suggest areas where further investigation is required, such as newer datasets, deeper regional analysis, or integrating socio-economic factors to better understand crime drivers.
